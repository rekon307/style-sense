# Visual Context Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of visual context functionality for Alex AI, allowing the AI to maintain memory of images from previous messages in conversations.

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **Table**: `chat_messages` with `visual_context` column for storing base64 images
- **Index**: `idx_chat_messages_visual_context` for performance optimization
- **Migration**: `20250614223949-60f4defa-1082-40d3-811c-10efb79884e9.sql`

### 2. Image Saving Flow (`useMessageHandler.ts`)
```
User sends message + image ‚Üí 
Save message with visual_context in DB ‚Üí 
Load visual history from DB ‚Üí 
Send to Edge Function with visual context
```

### 3. Visual Context Processing (`style-advisor/index.ts`)
```
Receives request with:
- Current image (high detail)
- Visual history (last 5 images, low detail)
- Text messages from conversation

‚Üí Builds OpenAI prompt with complete visual context
```

### 4. Automatic Image Capture (`imageCapture.ts` + `ChatInput.tsx`)
- Detects active webcam
- Automatically captures photo with each message
- Extensive debugging for troubleshooting

## Intended Functionality

### Primary Objective
Alex should be able to have multi-image conversations where:
- Remembers images from previous messages
- Can compare outfits from different sessions
- Provides advice based on user's stylistic progress

### Ideal Flow
```
Message 1: "How does my shirt look?" + image1
Alex: "Your shirt is blue with..."

Message 2: "And now how does it look?" + image2  
Alex: "I see you changed from the blue shirt to the red one..."
```

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Working:**
- Image saving to database
- Visual context loading for Alex
- Automatic image capture

‚ùì **To Test:**
- Whether Alex actually "sees" images from history
- Performance with multiple images
- Quality of responses with visual context

üîß **Files Needing Refactoring:**
- `useMessageHandler.ts` (245 lines - too long)
- `style-advisor/index.ts` (347 lines - too long)  
- `imageCapture.ts` (208 lines - too long)

## Technical Architecture

### Database Flow
1. User message captured with image
2. Image stored as base64 in `visual_context` column
3. Previous images loaded for context (last 5)
4. All visual data sent to OpenAI

### Edge Function Flow
1. Receives current image + visual history
2. Constructs enhanced prompt with visual context
3. Sends to OpenAI with proper image formatting
4. Streams response back to client

### Frontend Flow
1. Webcam captures image automatically
2. Message handler saves to database
3. Chat interface displays conversation
4. Real-time streaming of AI responses

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Test current functionality** - verify Alex can see historical images
2. **Refactor large files** into smaller, focused components
3. **Optimize performance** - limit context images if needed
4. **Implement authentication** for RLS policies

## Configuration Notes

- OpenAI Model: `gpt-4o-mini` (supports vision)
- Image Detail: High for current, Low for history
- Context Limit: 5 previous images
- Temperature: Configurable (0.2-0.8)
